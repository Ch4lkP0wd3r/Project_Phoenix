# Section 65B Compliance Guide: Project Phoenix

Project Phoenix is designed to support the admissibility of digital media evidence under **Section 65B of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA)** (formerly Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act).

## 🛡️ Chain of Custody & Integrity

To be admissible in a court of law, electronic records must be accompanied by a certificate that identifies the record and describes the manner in which it was produced. Project Phoenix facilitates this through:

1.  **Unique Identification**: Every piece of media is hashed using the **SHA-256** algorithm immediately upon upload. This "digital fingerprint" ensures that the file analyzed is identical to the file presented in court.
2.  **Automated Logging**: The system generates a `manifest.json` containing:
    *   Original filename and size.
    *   SHA-256 hash.
    *   UTC Timestamp of ingestion and analysis.
    *   Model versions and authenticity scores.
3.  **Cryptographic Proof**: The manifest is signed using a **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** server-side key. This ensures:
    *   **Authenticity**: The report was indeed generated by the Project Phoenix server.
    *   **Non-repudiation**: The server cannot deny generating the report.
    *   **Integrity**: The manifest has not been tampered with since its creation.
4.  **Secure Bundling**: All evidence (Manifest, PDF Report, and PGP Signature) is bundled into a ZIP file and encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**, protecting the chain of custody during transit.

## 📝 The Evidence Bundle

The downloaded ZIP contains:
- `manifest.json`: The machine-readable metadata.
- `manifest.json.sig`: The detached PGP signature.
- `report.pdf`: A human-readable summary for judicial review.

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer
Project Phoenix serves as an **expert advisory tool**. While the technical safeguards implemented align with Section 65B requirements for data integrity and provenance, the final certificate must be issued and signed by the person in charge of the computer system or a qualified forensic expert as per the specific requirements of the court.
