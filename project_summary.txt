"Project Phoenix" is a high-integrity AI platform designed for the detection of manipulated multimedia content, addressing the growing threat of deepfakes in legal and forensic contexts. Utilizing state-of-the-art architectures like XceptionNet and EfficientNet for visual analysis, and CNN-RNN hybrids for audio forensics, the system computes a comprehensive "Authenticity Score." Beyond detection, Project Phoenix prioritizes legal admissibility by generating a cryptographically signed evidence bundle. This bundle, including SHA-256 hashes, UTC timestamps, and a detailed PDF report, is specifically structured to comply with Section 65B of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA), ensuring a verifiable chain of custody. The full-stack solution features a robust FastAPI backend and a premium React-based dashboard, offering users a seamless interface for uploading media, visualizing manipulation artifacts, and downloading tamper-evident forensic reports. By blending advanced AI with rigorous forensic standards, Project Phoenix serves as a critical advisory tool for media authenticity verification in the digital age.
